# FitnessTracker
Created a fitness tracker class that includes data fields for a fitness activity, the number of minutes used interacting and the date. This class includes methods to get each field. In addition to it, created a default constructor that automatically sets the specific activity to running, the minutes to 0 and the date to a specific date of the current year. Inserted an additional overloaded constructor for the fitness tracker class you created previously. The constructor receives parameters for each pf the data fieldws and assigns them appropriately. Any needed statements to the test fitness application to ensure that the overloaded constructor works properly, save it, and test it.
